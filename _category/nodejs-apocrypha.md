This is `Node.JS Apocrypha`, a collection of code snippets, comments, and utilities that are useful for Node.js development.

All this comes from my personal experience as a new `Node.JS core collaborator`. If you are aiming to contribute to the Node.js core, you might find this useful.

_`Why it starts with the chapter two you might ask. Well, contents are emerging as I work on Node.JS stuff. Order will change a lot yet. What I think is a good 'first chapter' isn't even written`_  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
