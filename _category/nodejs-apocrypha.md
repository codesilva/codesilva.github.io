This is `Node.JS Apocrypha`, a collection of code snippets, comments, and utilities that are useful for Node.js development.

All this comes from my personal experience as a new `Node.JS core collaborator`. If you are aiming to contribute to the Node.js core, you might find this useful.

The book starts with understanding how Node.js bootstraps - from the moment you type `node your_script.js` until your code actually runs. From there, we explore the internals that make Node.js tick.
