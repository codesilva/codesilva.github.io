title: "Codeminer42's 2025 Year in Review: Community & Open Source"
---

In 2025, Codeminer42 was proudly involved in several community initiatives, from sponsoring conferences to contributing to open source projects. Here's a quick recap of our community involvement last year:

## Conference Speaking and Sponsorships

We believe that fostering the community is beneficial for everyone. In 2025 we sponsored and participated in conferences in Brazil and abroad:

### Ruby and Rails Conferences

#### The LAST Rails Conf

I was honored to be a speaker at the final edition of Rails Conf, where I shared insights on PWAs on how to ace them in Rails applications.

> Edy Silva’s talk lit a fire under me. As I watched, I wondered: could I get this working in a Hotwire Native app? After the talk I opened my laptop and two hours later had offline access working natively. I’ll share a full write-up soon - this could be huge for Hotwire Native.

#### Tropical on Rails

We proudly sponsored and spoke at Tropical on Rails, a conference that celebrates the vibrant Ruby on Rails community in Brazil. Even though I was a bit nervous, my fellow Codeminer42 colleagues cheered me on as I presented on building PWAs with Rails.

#### Rails World

Attending and sponsoring Rails World was a fantastic experience. This is the largest Ruby on Rails conference in the world, and being part of it allowed us to stay tuned into the latest trends and developments in the Rails ecosystem.

Talysson got on stage to talk about "XY Problem" in this AI era, discussing how to effectively leverage AI tools without falling into common pitfalls.

### JavaScript and Node.js Conferences

We're also present in the JavaScript community. In 2025, we participated in several key conferences where we learned and shared knowledge about JavaScript, Node.js, and a bit more.

#### The Developer's Conference (TDC)

In TDC Floripa 2025, I had the opportunity to speak about DX with Node.js, sharing best practices and tips to enhance developer experience when working with Node.js applications. Talysson presented two talks: one about functional programming in JavaScript and Domain Modeling.

In São Paulo, Talysson came back with two more great sessions: a panel discussion on assisted coding with AI and a talk on Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Joao Vogler brought an exciting talk about frontend resiliency.

#### Node Congress and JS Nation

We also led workshops. I put my Node.js collaborator hat on and led a workshop on SQLite and Node.js implementation at Node Congress.

In the end of the year, I came back to lead a workshop on interactive debugging with Node.js.

#### React Conf

I was thrilled to attend React Conf. I had a good expectation about the event, and it totally delivered. The talks were insightful, and I had the chance to connect with amazing people who build tools that we use daily like Tanstack Query and Excalidraw.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Conferences

There's room for more. In 2025, we also explored the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) community. Talysson spread the word of DDD around three different countries while speaking at Nerdearla in Argentina, Explore DDD in USA, and DDD Brasil in Brazil.

### Artificial Intelligence 

We're investing time and resources to understand how AI can help our development processes, our clients, and the community as a whole. In December, we attended QCon AI, where we learned about the latest advancements in AI and the various ways we can leverage it.

### Open Source Contributions & Team Growth

Open source is at the heart of what we do. We kept incentivizing our team to contribute to open source projects. I proudly became a Node.js core collaborator, contributing to the development and improvement of Node.js.

My colleagues and I drove important contributions to Node.js and Rails ecosystems, including but not limited to:

- node
- active record tenanted
- libuv
- freecodecamp

## Conclusion

What a year it has been! Contributing to the community is in our DNA at Codeminer42. We believe that being active members of the tech community helps us grow both as individuals and as a company.

We're grateful for the opportunities we've had in 2025 and look forward to continuing our community involvement in 2026. Let's make this year even better together!

Happy new year!
