<!-- As in 2023, Codemienr42 will present in the Rails Conf 2025: The Last One! It's a good time to recap the history of -->
<!-- Codeminer42 around the Ruby and Rails community. -->

Rails was launched in 2004 and it was a game changer for web development. It was very disruptive at the time, as it
didn't require a lot of boilerplate code and it was very easy to get started. It was a breath of fresh air for
developers who were used to complex frameworks like Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) and the fast-and-dirty PHP.

Not only that, it brought a lot of new practices that are now status quo in web development, such as Test Driven
Development (TDD), Continuous Integration (CI) and principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and YAGNI (You Aren't
Gonna Need It).

# Ruby and Rails Impact

Just like Rails, around 2004-2011, many other tools and products were born that are now essential for web development, such as git, AWS, GitHub and Heroku. The two last ones created using Rails.

Codeminer42 itself was born in 2011, as a company that wanted offer high-quality software development services. Founded by one of the early adopters of Rails in Brazil, all the innovations and practices that Rails brought were already part of the company's DNA.

Participating actively in the community, Codeminer42 organized the RubyConf Brasil conference for a couple of years: a place where Ruby and Rails enthusiasts could gather, share knowledge and network with each other, but also a place where other community members could share their own projects and ideas.

It was where two of today's Codeminer42 partners had their opportunities to present their first talks. This having a huge impact on their careers and the company itself.

There's much more on the history of Rails community in Brazil. To learn more, check out the following video (in PT-BR):

# The Last Rails Conf

After a huge succes with the RubyConf Brails 2015 one of the organizers, and Codeminer42 founder, Fábio Akita wrote in his blog:

> ...but for the reality of our market in Brazil, the focus is on how the developer can use Ruby and the surrounding tools to get the most out of their investment. We are more similar to the idea of “Railsconf”.

It turns out we had our own "RailsConf" in Brazil, and it was a great success. Ten years later, in 2025, the Rails community will gather for the Last Rails Conf in Philadelphia, PA, USA.

It will be a celebration of the impact that Rails has had on web development, a chance to reflect on the journey that the community has taken since its inception and look forward to the future of Rails.

We're very proud and excited to be part of such a milestone event, as it marks the end of an era for Rails and the
beginning of a new one.

See you in Philly!

Brazil is very well known for its vibrant Ruby and Rails community and it was made brick by brick by a few people who 
were passionate about the technology and wanted to share it with others. Codeminer42 is one of those companies that

<h1 id="a-journey-of-a-company-built-on-top-of-rails">A journey of a company built on top of Rails</h1>

<p>In 2005, in Brazil, DHH presented the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY">Ruby on Rails demo</a> where he built a blog in 15 minutes.</p>

<p>This was a pivotal moment for web development in Brazil, as it showcased the power and simplicity of Ruby on Rails. In
those days, developers were struggling with complex tools and bloated frameworks like Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) and
the fast-and-dirty PHP.</p>

<p>With Rails came a lot of new ideas and practices that revolutionized the way we built web applications. Not only that,
many of the tools and products we use today were born from the Rails community, such as git, GitHub, AWS and Heroku.</p>

<p>One of our founders actively participated in this Rails movement by organizing a Brazilian Ruby Conference named
RubyConf Brasil.</p>

<p>note for me: maybe i can have a timeline showing all the founded companies and products crated around 2000-2016 pointinh
codeminer42</p>

<p>and it was the spark that ignited the creation of
Codeminer42.</p>

# Ruby and Rails Conferences

The community is very strong. This can be seen in the number of conferences that are held every year around the world
and all the efforts that are made to aggregate all the knowledge produced in such events.

This inaugural event attracted between 400–600 attendees and marked the beginning of an annual tradition. In the following years, attendance grew rapidly, with the 2008 conference drawing approximately 1,800 participants.

The RailsConf is a killer event for the Ruby and Rails community, as it always brought great speakers, workshops and networking opportunities. It was a place where developers could learn about the latest trends and best practices in Ruby and Rails development, as well as share their own experiences and projects.

Almost twenty years later, the RailsConf is reaching its final chapter in 2025. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as
it's spiritual successor, the Rails World, is still going strong and bringing together the all the Ruby and Rails
folks/
