TODO

- setup a nodejs application with a not good bootstrap (maybe with express and knex|node:sqlite)
- fix the bootstraping, allowing it to be started as a console application and as a web server (some bugs only appear in
    production)
- create our own console using `node:repl`
- discuss how good it is, mention uses cases and AdonisJS
