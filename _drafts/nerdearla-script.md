## Intro

- Hello everybody. Welcome to this talk.
- My name is Edy, I'm a software developer at CodeMiner42
- Father to a beatufil daughter
- Husband to an adorable wife
- Also a content creator; check my links on beacons scanning this qrcode
- Today we're going to talk about software architecture. I'will shrea an unconventinoal application that I could apply
    an architectural pattern to.
- My main goal is, by sharing my challenges, give you some tips on how to architect any project, even the unconventional
    ones.

## The task runner

1. The application we will ba talking about today is the task runner.
2. It's the core of my team. It basically deals with background tasks, that's why it has this name (nice name!)
3. I had just arrived to the team. I can recall my teammates struggling to find and fix a bug. Actually, they were
   struggling to understand the flow of the application.
4. It was happening because this application, our core, was spreaded through three projects. It had no clear separation
   of concerns and no tests.
5. Sounds bad, right?
6. That's why we decided to rewrite it.
7. I was the responsible for such a project and I decided to have an architecture, an intentional architecture.
8. Whith a clear separation of concerns. I was aiming for an application that could be easy to change in various
   aspects.

## Hand-on

1. In order to apply an architecture you either master it or you make some analogies.
2. This talk exists, which means I didn't master it.
3. So I just searched for some content, also examples because I think that learning from examples is much easier.
4. From these examples, I started mounting the architecture of our project.

## Fundamentals of separation

1. The essence of the examples I found is that
2. We isolate tools from what most important in our application, the business logic.
3. I knew I could apply that to my project, for sure.

## What drives the application - the harder part

## The application

## What is driven by the application

## It has to start somewhere
