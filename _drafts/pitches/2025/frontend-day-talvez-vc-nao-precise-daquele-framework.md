# Showing a Need

Você quer se libertar e conhecer o que a web pode te oferecer de fato, sem ficar presos a frameworks.

# Satisfying the Need

Essa talk é pra você. Pois vamos passar pela história da web e vamos entender como ela funciona e tecnologias que
existem e entregam o mesmo que sua lib/framework favorita, mas sem a necessidade de você ficar preso a ela.

## Short Summary

You should contribute to NodeJS. Here's why:

- it's challenging: developers love challenges;
- it's rewarding: you give back to the community and get notoriety;
- it's easier than you think, you probably have the skills to make a relevant contribution already: most of the codebase is JavaScript;
- the core team people are always there to help you with patience and respect.

In this workshop, you will learn a ground-up approach to contributing to Node.js. We will compile, add features, and write tests for Node.js. We will also learn how to write documentation and interact with the core team in various ways.

## Workshop Description

This workshop is for anyone who wants to start contributing to Node.js. This workshop is for anyone who wants to start contributing to Node.js. If I, an average person, could do it, anyone can.

We will work on a fictional feature to be added to Node.js. We will learn how to navigate the codebase, add features to both JavaScript and C++ side, write tests and documentation, and interact with the community.

### Outcomes

- Learn NodeJS internals: V8, libuv, and the Node.js core
- Understand how C++ and JavaScript talk to each other
- Learn how to do open-source work
- Learn about integration tests. Those used in Node.js

### Outline

#### Intro

- What's open source: I explain what open source is and give reasons why you should do that.
- Why contribute to Node.js: Node Core are great people you can learn a lot from. That's not true for other projects. I state the rewards of contributing to Node.js and why it's even easier than other projects with less kind maintainers.

#### Getting Started

- Setting up your environment: fork, clone and compile Node.js
- Navigate the codebase - understanding the structure of the codebase
    - C++ side
    - JavaScript side
    - Tests
    - Documentation
    - Deps (v8, libuv, etc.)

#### Hands-on

We will work on a fictional feature involving async operations so we can cover both the JavaScript and C++ sides. This feature is a simple copy file operation (but using different system calls, as BunJS did).

NOTE: The feature here is less important than the process of adding it. So if the organization thinks we can simplify it, I'm okay with that.

- Adding a feature
    - JavaScript side
    - C++ side
- Writing tests
- Writing documentation
- Running tests and linter

#### Interacting with the community

- Opening a PR
- Interacting with the core team

## Short Bio

In 2024, I started contributing to NodeJS (https://github.com/nodejs/node/commits/main/?author=geeksilva97), and it has been an amazing experience! I fell in love with the community and, even more, with JavaScript.

I'm just a regular person who loves challenges and learning new things. If I could do it, you can do it too!
