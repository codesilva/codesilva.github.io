How I used the Node.js VM module to build a tool for managing Application Alerts

How To Make Tools Using Node.js VM Module

How We Improved Our Observability Tool Using Node.js VM Module (And How You Can Too)

How you can improve your team's Developer Experience with Node.js VM Module

# Features and Benefits

| Features | Benefits |
| --- | --- |
| One more option for tools | It unleashes the power of your tools |
| Run code in a secure sandbox | You will be able to run JS code in a controlled manner |
| Simple and effective | You can build powerful tools with not much effort |

# 4U's

- Urgency: (1)
- Uniqueness: Unique. (4)
    Unique since there isn't much about VM module use cases out there
- Ultra-specific: Very specific. (4)
    Specific since it's focused on NodeJS and on an specific module
- Useful: Very useful. (3)
    useful for developers who want to build tools

# Showing a Need

The Engineering team in most cases is what will make the difference between your product and your competitor's. Providing a good environment allows your team to deliver a better product.

One way to improve the Engineering team's experience is to provide them with good tools. They will feel more comfortable and will be able to deliver better results.

# Satisfying the Need

The Node.js VM module is a powerful tool that allows you to run JavaScript code in a secure sandbox. This module is
often overlooked, but it can be a powerful tool for building great developer tools.

In this talk, we will see the Node.js VM module applied to a tool we used to manage Application Alerts.

# Talk Abstract

As a developer, you are always seeking better ways to do your job. You pick what you think is the best editor, the best programming language, the best framework, and so on. You pick the best tools for a better Developer Experience.

Sometimes you have to build your own tools. And that's where the Node.js VM module comes in. This module, even though it's  overlooked sometimes, allows you to run JavaScript code in a controlled sandbox.'

In this talk, I bring you a real-world use case of Node.js VM module that we used to build an Obersable tool for managing Application Alerts.

# Longer Description

This talk is intended for anyone wanting to build better tools for developers and see how the Node.js VM module can help you with that.

## Outcomes

- Understand the Node.js VM module
- Learn how to use the VM module to build tools
- See a real-world tool that uses the VM module
- Understand a bit of concepts like Realms and Contexts

## Outline

- Developer Experience: What is it and why it matters
    I explain, with some of my experience, why DX is important and how it can make a difference in your team's
    productivity and product quality.

- The Orwell project: a tool for managing Application Alerts
    I present the Orwell project, a tool we built to manage Application Alerts on top of Elastic Watchers. I talk about the motivations behind building this tool and how it helped us.

- Before the VM module: tool limitations and options we considered
    I talk about the limitations we faced with Orwell and how we solved them using the Node.js VM module.

- The Node.js VM module
    I introduce the Node.js VM module and explain how it works.

- Orwell after VM module and its benefits
    I show how we used just simple concepts of the VM module and made our tool way better.

## Bio

I'm a regular person who loves challenges and learning new things.

I've been working with JavaScript and Node.js for 10+ years now. I'm passionate about programming and creating tools. During the last year I realized there are great native modules for building tools (e.g. VM and REPL). 

With VM I could improve one of our tools making it straightforward and much more effective.
