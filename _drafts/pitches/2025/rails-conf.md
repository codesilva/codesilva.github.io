| The Rails way (conventions and generation) | Understand Rails way and see how anything can be applied to it |
| HTML APIs are evolving | Expand the capabilities and the performance of your application |
| There is a gap between the fresh new installation and what a PWA actually needs to work | Fill that knowledge gap |

| Urgency | Uniqueness | Ultra-specific | Useful |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 - not that urgent since it's for the future  | 3 - Unique since it focuses on PWAs looking ahead | Specific about how to deal with PWAs in Rails wat | 4 - Useful
information not only for experienced but for new Rails devs |

# Showing a Need

You created a fresh new Rails app - that comes with the most basic PWA setup - but you don't know the next steps.
There's a lot to cover on PWAs and you can't see how this fit to Rails.

# Satisfying the Need

In this talk, I will fill this gap. I will show you the most important PWA patterns you need to know and how to make
them to work with Rails.

## Description

### Pitch

Rails is one of the best frameworks to build web applications. It's simple, yet powerful. Core Rails is always adding
new features that make increase productivity and make the developer's life easier.

Since version 7.2, Rails has been adding PWA components to the default setup. DHH himself said that he will be pushing
hard for PWAs: "No native apps, just the very best PWAs you can build."

There are lots of HTML APIs that can make your app to behave like a native app. Device native features like Geocoding, Device
Motion, Battery status, and more can be accessed through the browser.

PWA implementations are evolving. The new `ActionNotifier` gem is on its way to make it easier to send push notifications.
But PWAs have a lot more to offer and you can start using them today in a Rails-way so you can be ready for when Rails
is indeed, full PWA-ready.

### Outcomes

After attending this talk, the audience should know:

1. Know the most important PWA patterns: Cache and caching strategies, Push Notifications, and Offline Capabilities.
2. How to leverage Rails to implement these patterns today (e.g. Rails generators).
3. What to expect from Rails in the future regarding PWAs.

### Outline

#### Intro

    - Cache and caching strategies
    - Push Notifications
    - Offline Capabilities

#### Fit PWAs in Rails way

- The Rails way
- Rails gnereators for PWAs

#### Where do we go from here?

- What to expect from ActionNotifier
- What to expct from Rails regarding PWAs

### Aditional Notes

I’ve been a software developer for 10 years now. I worked with a variety of web frameworks in different programming languages. In the last three years, I’ve been working with and writing about Ruby and Rails. Both became my favorite technologies. I even led a workshop where we made a Database from scratch in plain Ruby and as an open-source enthusiast, I’ve been contributing to projects using Ruby on Rails.

My background in mobile and JavaScript development makes me a good fit because I have the perspective of someone who worked with native and hybrid implementations and I can speak confidently that most of the apps can be easily achieved with PWAs - I even started an [article series](https://blog.codeminer42.com/everything-you-need-to-ace-pwas-in-rails-part-ii/) where I show the PWA concepts and how you could apply them to Ruby on Rails. HTML APIs are powerful today allowing us to access file systems, bluetooth devices, geocoding, and much more!

I also enjoy writing tools. Using Rails generators is a great way to build tools that can be used by your team and the community.
