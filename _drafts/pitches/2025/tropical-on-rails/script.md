Hello, eveyone! I'm very glad to be here at the Tropical on Rails stage.
My name is Edy, I'm a software developer at codeminer42, a father of to a cute daugheter and a husband of a wonderful
wife.

I'm here to talk about Hotwire and the Platform.
Well... I have to tell you that "The Platform" is web, and web is JavaScript. So, I'm here indeed to talk about Hotwire
and JavaScript (laughs)

But a bit of JavaScript will get your Rails application to the next level. It will be installable, offline-reponsive,
and will have a better user experience.

## Agenda
