# Showing a Need

You are a human being and you are pretty sure you can do more. Industry, however, is pushing you to be a specialist;
forcing you to dedicate your whole professional life to a single technology, a single framework, a single library.

frameworks, estamos aprendendo as partes sem entender o todo.
