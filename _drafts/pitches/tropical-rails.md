# Features and Benefits

| Features | Benefits |
| --- | --- |
| More Rails; Just a bit of JavaScript | You already have all tools you need. Just Rails and Hotwire are enough |
| Offline-capable application | Much more engaging since your app can be used even without internet |
| Engaging with Vibration api and push notifications | Engage your customer |
| Beautiful and smooh pages with View Transition | You will have an application that people will prefer to use |
| Stop struggling with App Store and Play Store | Gain productivity. Deployments are straightforward. No Apple or Google deying you |
| Efficient application (Background Fetch API) | Improve user experience. Don't make your customer wait |

# 4U's

- Urgency: Not that urgent. You are not obligated to use PWAs. (1)
- Uniqueness: PWA talks are not unique. But in the context of Rails this is unique. There were two talks on PWA recently but they focused on the basic part. The setup. This talk is about what it can do (3)
- Ultra-specific: very specific on PWA capabilities in a Rails app (3)
- Useful: very useful since that's a rails direction. PWA files are default and there's [ActionNotifier](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50454) going on (3)

# Showing a Need

A software is written to be useful. You can have a high-quality software but if your customers can't use it, it's useless.

With Rails and Hotwire you can productively build very good apps. But you want more. You want engaging and smoothness.

# Satisfying the Need

The union PWA + HTML APIs will get you there! Get in touch with what's new with Vibration, View Transition, and Push
APIs and build apps that engage 120% more!
