# A journey of a company built on top of Rails

In 2005, in Brazil, DHH presented the famous [Ruby on Rails demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY) where he built a blog in 15 minutes.

This was a pivotal moment for web development in Brazil, as it showcased the power and simplicity of Ruby on Rails. In
those days, developers were struggling with complex tools and bloated frameworks like Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) and
the fast-and-dirty PHP.

With Rails came a lot of new ideas and practices that revolutionized the way we built web applications. Not only that,
many of the tools and products we use today were born from the Rails community, such as git, GitHub, AWS and Heroku.

One of our founders actively participated in this Rails movement by organizing a Brazilian Ruby Conference named
RubyConf Brasil.

note for me: maybe i can have a timeline showing all the founded companies and products crated around 2000-2016 pointinh

and it was the spark that ignited the creation of
Codeminer42.
