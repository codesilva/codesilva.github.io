# Two's complement trick revealed


In my last post, I broguth light to IEEE 754 standard and I got some sections to give you an overview how computers do
math.

We established that the IEEE 754 standard is not that useful for integer numbers and we used two's complement instead.
In that post I promised to get back for a deeper explanation of Two~s complement.


# Recap two's complement

## The Definition

> Twoâ€™s complement is a mathematical operation to reversibly convert a positive binary number into a negative binary number with an equivalent negative value, using the binary digit with the greatest place value as the sign to indicate whether the binary number is positive or negative. It is used in computer science as the most common method of representing signed (positive, negative, and zero) integers on computers,[1] and more generally, fixed point binary values. When the most significant bit is 1, the number is signed as negative; and when the most significant bit is 0 the number is signed as positive.

## Our 3-bit machine

| Binary  | Decimal  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| 000  |  0 |
| 001  | 1  |
| 010 | 2  |
| 011  |  3 |
| 100  |  -4 |
| 101  | -3  |
| 110  |  -2  |
| 111  |  -1 |

## Playing a bit

In two's complement we can convert a positive binary number into a negative binary number and vice versa using the same
procedure that is describe as following:

1. invert all bits;
2. add 1 to the result from last step.

### Conversions

#### Converting 3 to -3

We get 3 (10) that is `011` and then:

1. invert all bits resulting into `100`
2. add `1` to `100` resulting into `101`.

Our final result is `101` which is, indeed, -3 (10)

#### Converting -2 to 2

We get 2 (10) that is `010` then:

1. invert all bits resulting into `101`;
2. add `1` to the result from step 1, so `101 + 1` resulting into `110`.

After applying the procedure we ended up with `110` that is `-2 (10)`.

# Trick Revealed

It's all modular arihmetic it's been that all this time.

## Modular Arithmetic 101

Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers where numbers reset when reaching a certain value - known as modulus.

A familiar application of this arithmetic is the 12-hour clock. Every twelve hours the time gets reset. If it's 11:00,
then 2 hours later it will be 1:00. Indeed, 11 + 2 is equal to 13 which in modulus 12 it becomes 1 - because we reset whenever it reaches to the _modulus_, 12 in this case. We say that 13 and 1 are congruents modulus 12.

#### In math notation:

1 &TildeFullEqual; 13 (mod 12)

Twelve, in this case, is the modulus. Whenever the number reaches tweleve, it gets reset. That's why `13 (mod 12) = 1`.
If you think more you figure out that `26 (mod 12)` is also congruent to `1`.

Think about it:

```
13 = (12 + 1) // one cycle completed plus 1
25 = (24 + 1) // two cycles completed plus 1
```

Every completed cycle turns the clock to zero, so adding 1 to the result is equal to 1. I hope it didn't confuse that
much. We will see more details in the next section.

### Congruence

_a_ and _b_ are said to be congruent _modulo n_ if there's an integer _k_ such that:

a - b = kn, n > 1

It's to see that this relation can also be written as:

```
a = kn + b.
```

It looks familiar to what we saw in the last section. We defined 25 congruent to 1 in modulus 12. If we write using the
relation showed before we have

```
25 = 12k + 1.
```

That's exactly what we did with the 24 + 1. 24 is just 12 &times; 2. So, 24 + 1 = 12&times;2 + 1 - our _k_ is 2.

## How it applies to Two's complement

The whole thing is about _cycles_. We get an infinite set of numbers and we make it to fit into a smaller set.
Any integer number modulus 12 will never be less than zero neither greater than eleven. Numbers in modulus `n` have the
range: zero to `n-1`.

It's important to observe how the things get complimented. In modulus 12, to get from 1 to 11 we can either:

- subtract 2;
- or add 10.

To get from 1 to 10 we can either add 9 ou subtract 3. If you put it into a table you'll eventually reach to the
following relation:

```
Subtract "a" from a number "b" modulus n is equivalent to add n - a.

Hence, b - a (mod n) <=> b + (n - a) (mod n)
```

Illustrating, subtract 2 from 1 (mod 12) is the same as adding 10 (aka 12 - 2). Subtracting 3 is the same as adding
9 (aka 12 - 3).

### Applying the concepts

In our 3-bit machine, thinking about about unsigned numbers we can represent from 0 to 7. We can't represent less
or more, if we get an overflow like 1000<sub>2</sub> it actually gets "reset" to 000<sub>2</sub>. Well, it's easy now that we know the behaviour of a number in modular arithmetic.

Our machine is, indeed, modulus 8. So, subtracting a number `a` from any number `b` in our machine is the same as adding
`8 - a`.

Let's say we want to subtract two from any any number. Remember, we are operating in modulus eight. Thus, in our
relation we just need to add (8 - 2).

1000<sub>2</sub> - 010<sub>2</sub> <=> (1<sub>2</sub> + 111<sub>2</sub>) - 010<sub>2</sub>

It does not look that much. Let's rearrange it into two parts as shown below.

1. 111<sub>2</sub> - 010<sub>2</sub>.
2. sum the result from last step to one.

If you take a closer look you will find out that the first step (`111 - 010`) just flips the bits resulting into `101` - the first part
of Two's complement procedure.

The second step adds `1` to the result. In this example, 101<sub>2</sub> + 1<sub>2</sub> resulting into 110<sub>2</sub> - the second part of Two's complement procedure.

#### Performing operation from scratch

Let's perform the operation 3 - 2.

011<sub>2</sub> + (111<sub>2</sub> - 010<sub>2</sub> + 1<sub>2</sub>)
=> 011<sub>2</sub> + (101<sub>2</sub> + 1<sub>2</sub>)
=> 011<sub>2</sub> + 110<sub>2</sub> = 1001<sub>2</sub> => 001<sub>2</sub>
