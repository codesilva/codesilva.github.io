Hi, I'm Edy Silva and I live in a small town of Cear√° with my beautiful wife and my kid. This blog is meant to document
my thoughts. Since I think a lot about `programming`, `learning` and `reading` there will be recurring subjects here.

This blog isn't be the most beautiful you've ever seen, but hopefully it has some useful content.

A curious fact about this blog is that it's highly inspired by Jeremy Foster's blog. He used to work at Microsoft and
owns the [codefoster.com](http://codefoster.com/) blog.

I heard about this guy in an HTML & CSS course I attended on Microsoft Virtual Academy. I tried to find a link for the course but I couldn't. It might be outdated today so who cares?
