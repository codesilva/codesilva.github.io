  You have 2 tasks assigned to you in this project. Would you like to see
  those tasks, or do something else with this project?

> i want to use this project to help me with my blog posts pipeline.

i would like to change it to a proper name and description 

⏺ I'll update the project name and description for your blog posts pipeline.
   Let me do that:

⏺ asana - Update task (MCP)(task_id: "1212010313725982", name: "Blog Posts
                           Pipeline", notes: "Project to manage the blog post
                           creation and publication pipeline, from ideation
                           through publishing.")
  ⎿  Error: [
       {
         "message": "task: Not the correct type",
         "help": "For more information on API status codes and how to handle 
     them, read the docs on errors: https://developers.asana.com/docs/errors"
       }
     ]

⏺ Let me use the correct API endpoint for projects:

⏺ asana - Create project (MCP)(name: "Blog Posts Pipeline", notes: "Project to
                              manage the blog post creation and publication
                              pipeline, from ideation through publishing.",
                              workspace: "28835538962165", owner: "me")
  ⎿  Error: [
       {
         "message": "Missing required `team` field",
         "help": "For more information on API status codes and how to handle 
     them, read the docs on errors: https://developers.asana.com/docs/errors"
       }
     ]

⏺ Unfortunately, the Asana MCP doesn't have an API endpoint to update
  project names and descriptions directly. The available endpoints only
  support creating new projects or reading project data.

  However, I can help you in another way. Would you like me to:

  1. Create a new project with the proper name "Blog Posts Pipeline" and
  description, then you can manually delete the old one and move your tasks
  over
  2. Or you can update it directly in Asana through the web/app interface

  Which would you prefer?

> create a new project, and in the TODO, add my firts task that is: write a 
blog post about MCPs 

⏺ asana - Create project (MCP)(name: "Blog Posts Pipeline", notes: "Project to
                              manage the blog post creation and publication
                              pipeline, from ideation through publishing.",
                              workspace: "28835538962165", team:
                              "1212010313725976", owner: "me")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {
         "gid": "1212010414775875",
     … +58 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now let me create the task for writing a blog post about MCPs:

⏺ asana - Create task (MCP)(name: "Write a blog post about MCPs", project_id:
                           "1212010414775875", assignee: "me")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {
         "gid": "1212010328510821",
     … +70 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I've created your new Blog Posts Pipeline project and added your
  first task.

  Project created:
  - Name: Blog Posts Pipeline
  - Description: Project to manage the blog post creation and publication
  pipeline, from ideation through publishing.
  - Link: https://app.asana.com/1/28835538962165/project/1212010414775875

  Task created:
  - Name: Write a blog post about MCPs
  - Assigned to: You
  - Status: Upcoming
  - Link: https://app.asana.com/1/28835538962165/project/1212010414775875/ta
  sk/1212010328510821

  Your project is all set up and ready to use! Would you like to add more
  tasks to the pipeline or set up any sections for different stages (like
  "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", "Published")?

> /export 
  ⎿  Conversation exported to: 2025-11-20-claude-session-with-asanamcp.txt

> yes, need different stages. go ahead and create them 

⏺ asana - Get project sections (MCP)(project_id: "1212010414775875")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": [
         {
     … +6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I can see the project has a default "Untitled section". Unfortunately, the
   Asana MCP doesn't provide endpoints to create or update sections
  directly. However, I can help you set this up through the Asana web
  interface.

  You'll want to create these stages in your project:

  1. Ideation - New blog post ideas
  2. Drafting - Posts being written
  3. Review - Posts ready for feedback/editing
  4. Published - Completed and published posts

  You can create these sections by:
  - Opening your project in Asana
  - Clicking the "+" button to add new sections
  - Or renaming the "Untitled section" to your first stage

  Would you like me to help you organize your existing task or add more
  tasks to the project while you set up the sections?

> yes go ahead, be autonomous as possible, no need for confirming every step
 

⏺ Let me create a few more blog post tasks to populate your pipeline:

⏺ asana - Create task (MCP)(name: "Brainstorm blog post ideas for next quarter",
                            project_id: "1212010414775875", assignee: "me")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {
         "gid": "1212010421135973",
     … +70 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ asana - Create task (MCP)(name: "Edit and review MCPs blog post", project_id:
                           "1212010414775875", assignee: "me")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {
         "gid": "1212010334308005",
     … +70 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ asana - Create task (MCP)(name: "Publish MCPs blog post", project_id:
                           "1212010414775875", assignee: "me")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {
         "gid": "1212010334992613",
     … +70 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ asana - Create task (MCP)(name: "Promote blog post on social media",
                           project_id: "1212010414775875", assignee: "me")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {
         "gid": "1212010476076104",
     … +70 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I've created 4 additional tasks to populate your blog pipeline.
  Now let me set up task dependencies to create a workflow sequence:

⏺ asana - Set task dependencies (MCP)(task_id: "1212010334308005", dependencies:
                                      ["1212010328510821"])
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {}
     }

⏺ asana - Set task dependencies (MCP)(task_id: "1212010334992613", dependencies:
                                      ["1212010334308005"])
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {}
     }

⏺ asana - Set task dependencies (MCP)(task_id: "1212010476076104", dependencies:
                                      ["1212010334992613"])
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {}
     }

⏺ Done! I've set up your Blog Posts Pipeline with:

  5 Tasks created:
  1. ✓ Write a blog post about MCPs
  2. ✓ Brainstorm blog post ideas for next quarter
  3. ✓ Edit and review MCPs blog post
  4. ✓ Publish MCPs blog post
  5. ✓ Promote blog post on social media

  Task dependencies configured:
  - Edit task depends on Write task
  - Publish task depends on Edit task
  - Promote task depends on Publish task

  This creates a workflow sequence where each stage blocks the next one
  until complete.

  Next step: You'll need to create the project sections in the Asana UI to
  match your pipeline stages:
  - Ideation
  - Drafting
  - Review
  - Published

  Then you can manually organize these tasks into their respective sections.
   The workflow is ready to go!

> can't you go and create the project sections? 

⏺ Unfortunately, the Asana MCP doesn't provide an API endpoint to create or
  modify project sections. The available tools only allow me to:

  - Read project sections (list them)
  - Create tasks within sections
  - Move tasks between sections

  But I cannot create new sections themselves through the API. This is a
  limitation of the Asana MCP integration.

  To create the sections, you'll need to:
  1. Go to your Asana project:
  https://app.asana.com/1/28835538962165/project/1212010414775875
  2. Click the "+" button or "Add section" option
  3. Create your 4 stages: Ideation, Drafting, Review, Published

  I apologize for this limitation! Is there anything else I can help you
  with regarding your blog pipeline tasks?
