> List tasks assigned to me 

⏺ I'll retrieve your assigned tasks from Asana.
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": [
         {
     … +6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Now I'll search for tasks assigned to you in this workspace:

⏺ asana - Search tasks (MCP)(workspace: "28835538962165", assignee_any: "me")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": [
         {
     … +43 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Here are the tasks assigned to you:

  1. Edit and review MCPs blog post
  2. Publish MCPs blog post
  3. Promote blog post on social media
  4. Write a blog post about MCPs
  5. Brainstorm blog post ideas for next quarter
  6. Draft project brief
  7. Schedule kickoff meeting

  You have 7 tasks total. Would you like more details about any specific
  task, such as due dates, descriptions, or project context?

> move the task "Write a blog post about MCPs" to "In progress" 

⏺ I'll update that task to mark it as in progress.

⏺ asana - Get task (MCP)(task_id: "1212010328510821")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {
         "gid": "1212010328510821",
     … +70 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I'll move the task to "In progress" by updating its assignee section. Let
  me get the project sections first to find the "In progress" section.

⏺ asana - Get project sections (MCP)(project_id: "1212010414775875")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": [
         {
     … +11 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I'll move the task to the "in progress" section:

⏺ asana - Update task (MCP)(task_id: "1212010328510821")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {
         "gid": "1212010328510821",
     … +70 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I need to move the task to the "in progress" section in the project. Let
  me update it with the correct section:

⏺ asana - Update task (MCP)(task_id: "1212010328510821")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": {
         "gid": "1212010328510821",
     … +70 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I see the issue - the Asana API doesn't have a direct way to move tasks
  between sections through the update_task endpoint. However, I can use the
  assignee_section parameter to move it within your personal task list, or
  you may need to move it manually in the Asana UI to the "in progress"
  section of the project.

  Alternatively, in Asana, tasks are typically moved to different sections
  by using custom fields or by manually dragging them in the project view.
  The current API doesn't support direct section assignment through the task
   update endpoint.

  Would you like me to help you in another way, such as adding a comment to
  the task or setting other properties like due dates or followers?

> how many tasks do i have in progress? 

⏺ I'll search for tasks assigned to you that are in the "in progress"
  section.

⏺ asana - Search tasks (MCP)(workspace: "28835538962165", assignee_any: "me",
                            sections_any: "1212010313726105")
  ⎿  {                                                                     
       "data": []
     }

⏺ You currently have 0 tasks in progress. The "in progress" section is empty
   for your assigned tasks.
